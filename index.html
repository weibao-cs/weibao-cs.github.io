    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p> I'm a Senior  Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at The University of Sydney.  </p>
    <p>I finished my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, working with <a href="http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/">Prof. Ben Liang</a>. </p>
    <p>I received B.Eng. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in telecommunications engineering in 2009 and M.A.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia in electrical and computer engineering in 2011. </p>

    <p>My research interests cover the broad area of networked systems, with particular emphasis on analysis and optimization of mobile networks, distributed machine learning, Internet of Things, and edge computing.</p>

 <p><b>Distributed machine learning. </b> In the real world, a large proportion of machine learning (ML) tasks are implemented in a distributed manner, as datasets and computational resources are distributed. Many ML data are not perfect, so it is essential to use the rich and diverse data without perfect labels. We develop new solutions to address the key challenges of speed, scalability and efficiency in distributed ML workflows.  </p>
 <p>AI for networked systems. </b>  Traditional Internet applications are fundamentally limited by network infrastructure (bandwidth), while we have developed new solutions by integrating AI and networks to achieve high-quality digital applications without investing in network infrastructure.  </p>
 <p>Optimisation for intelligent networks. </b>  It is highly desirable to optimise the performance of intelligent networks through rigorous analysis and capture the strategic interactions between different parties in the large-scale systems.  </p>
